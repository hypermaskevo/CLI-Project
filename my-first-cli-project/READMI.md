# My First CLI Project

This is a beginner-friendly project to practice working with the Linux command line (CLI).

## Project Structure
## Goals

- Learn basic file and directory commands: `touch`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`
- Create and manage a simple project structure via terminal
- Practice using Git and GitHub for version control

## Tasks

- Create files and folders using the CLI
- Move and copy files between directories
- Write basic bash script in `analyze.sh`
- Initialize Git repository and push it to GitHub

## Notes

This project is part of a hands-on CLI learning path. It focuses on building muscle memory and confidence when working in a terminal environment.
